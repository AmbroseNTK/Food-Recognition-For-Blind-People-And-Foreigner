<h2>
1. About me
</h2>
<p>

Welcome to my MLC GitHub page. My name is ***Kiet Nguyen Tuan (Ambrose)*** . I worte these lines when I was a senior student at ***Hoasen University, Vietnam***. Because of special love with Machine Learning, so I have come to this ML Camp hosted at Jeju National University to do my project. I also want to meet new friends from other countries. It was a experiement I never forget.
</p>

<h2>
2. What is it?
</h2>
<p>

In this project, I would like to develop a collection of model that can use to recognize food and its ingredients. For me, I create these models for Vietnamese food first. Developers in other countries can contribute their national food models to my collection. After that, every people can use these models free, so that apply to their app.
</p>

<h2>
3. Why?
</h2>
<p>
When I found a idea for this camp, I realised that food is an important part of country's culture so that every people should have knowledge about food of place where they stay at. Moreover, disable people, specially blind people also need help to know what food they eat. For foreigner, I will be an useful food's guideline at place their visit and also be an assitant to track what their eat and suggest what they should or should not eat.
<p>

4. My plan
</h2>
<p>
Due to shortly time of this camp (July 22 to August 7, 2018) and I do not have enough data, I cannot finish all project at the camp. But I still continue to finish.</br>
Here is my plan</br>

Day | Date | What I did
--- | --- | ---
1 | July 22, 2018 | I came to Jeju island lately due to a storm at Shanghai.
2 | July 23, 2018 | I prepared a introduction presentation and attended MLC Opening Ceremony.
3 | July 24, 2018 | I visited Jeju Development Center and had a seminar about blockchain with AI.
4 | July 25, 2018 | I reviewed all my project which I have prepared at home and viewed Google Cloud Platform tutorial.
5 | July 26, 2018 | I re-designed UI for Android App and applied Firebase.
6 | July 27, 2018 | I checked my dataset for food detection and downloaded more images from Google Image.
7 | July 28, 2018 | I retrained food detection model, it could recognize about 10 Vietnamese food (Bun, pho, com,...).
8 | July 29, 2018 | It was a weekend so I had around trip at Jeju island.
9 | July 30, 2018 | I prepared dataset for ingredient detection.
10 | July 31, 2018 | I tried to train object detection model (ingredient detection) on local PC but it was slowly.
11 | Aug 1, 2018 | I used Google Cloud Platform, I created two Virtual Machine, one at Japan and the other at Taiwan. The VM at Taiwan had large CPU and Memory (vCPU: 8, Memory: 52GB) so it was a little bit faster than my laptop.
12 | Aug 2, 2018 | I returned to my laptop. Installed tensorflow-gpu and tried to use my GPU card NVIDIA GT 740M. I trained on my laptop and it was the fastest (about 1 second per training step). After 2 hours, my GPU card was broken down, I could not use it after.
