  """Splits src_dim and sends one of the pieces to another dim.

  Terminology:
  A matrix is often described as 'row-major' or 'column-major', which doesn't
  help if you can't remember which is the row index and which is the column,
  even if you know what 'major' means, so here is a simpler explanation of it:
  When TF stores a tensor of size [d0, d1, d2, d3] indexed by [i0, i1, i2, i3],
  the memory address of an element is calculated using:
  ((i0 * d1 + i1) * d2 + i2) * d3 + i3, so, d0 is the MOST SIGNIFICANT dimension
  and d3 the LEAST SIGNIFICANT, just like in the decimal number 1234, 1 is the
  most significant digit and 4 the least significant. In both cases the most
  significant is multiplied by the largest number to determine its 'value'.
  Furthermore, if we reshape the tensor to [d0'=d0, d1'=d1 x d2, d2'=d3], then
  the MOST SIGNIFICANT part of d1' is d1 and the LEAST SIGNIFICANT part of d1'
  is d2.

  Action:
  transposing_reshape splits src_dim into factors [part_a, part_b], and sends
  the most significant part (of size  part_a) to be the most significant part of
  dest_dim_a*(Exception: see NOTE 2), and the least significant part (of size
  part_b) to be the most significant part of dest_dim_b.
  This is basically a combination of reshape, rotating transpose, reshape.
  NOTE1: At least one of dest_dim_a and dest_dim_b must equal src_dim, ie one of
  the parts always stays put, so src_dim is never totally destroyed and the
  output number of dimensions is always the same as the input.
  NOTE2: If dest_dim_a == dest_dim_b == src_dim, then parts a and b are simply
  transposed within src_dim to become part_b x part_a, so the most significant
  part becomes the least significant part and vice versa. Thus if you really
  wanted to make one of the parts the least significant side of the destiantion,
  the destination dimension can be internally transposed with a second call to
  transposing_reshape.
  NOTE3: One of part_a and part_b may be -1 to allow src_dim to be of unknown
  size with one known-size factor. Otherwise part_a * part_b must equal the size
  of src_dim.
  NOTE4: The reshape preserves as many known-at-graph-build-time dimension sizes
  as are available.

  Example:
  Input dims=[5, 2, 6, 2]
  tensor=[[[[0, 1][2, 3][4, 5][6, 7][8, 9][10, 11]]
           [[12, 13][14, 15][16, 17][18, 19][20, 21][22, 23]]
          [[[24, 25]...
  src_dim=2, part_a=2, part_b=3, dest_dim_a=3, dest_dim_b=2
  output dims =[5, 2, 3, 4]
  output tensor=[[[[0, 1, 6, 7][2, 3, 8, 9][4, 5, 10, 11]]
                  [[12, 13, 18, 19][14, 15, 20, 21][16, 17, 22, 23]]]
                 [[[24, 26, 28]...
  Example2:
  Input dims=[phrases, words, letters]=[2, 6, x]
  tensor=[[[the][cat][sat][on][the][mat]]
         [[a][stitch][in][time][saves][nine]]]
  We can factorize the 6 words into 3x2 = [[the][cat]][[sat][on]][[the][mat]]
  or 2x3=[[the][cat][sat]][[on][the][mat]] and
  src_dim=1, part_a=3, part_b=2, dest_dim_a=1, dest_dim_b=1
  would yield:
  [[[the][sat][the][cat][on][mat]]
   [[a][in][saves][stitch][time][nine]]], but
  src_dim=1, part_a=2, part_b=3, dest_dim_a=1, dest_dim_b=1
  would yield:
  [[[the][on][cat][the][sat][mat]]
   [[a][time][stitch][saves][in][nine]]], and
  src_dim=1, part_a=2, part_b=3, dest_dim_a=0, dest_dim_b=1
  would yield:
  [[[the][cat][sat]]
   [[a][stitch][in]]
   [[on][the][mat]]
   [[time][saves][nine]]]
  Now remember that the words above represent any least-significant subset of
  the input dimensions.
