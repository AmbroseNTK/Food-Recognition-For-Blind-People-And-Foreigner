  median residual is at least 3*sigma (where sigma is a robust estimate of the
  standard deviation of the residuals), those points are removed and the spline

  Some Kepler light curves have low-frequency variability, while others have

  computes the best-fit spline by fitting splines with different break-point
  spacings, calculating the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for each
  spline, and choosing the break-point spacing that minimizes the BIC.

  This function assumes a piecewise light curve, that is, a light curve that is
  divided into different segments (e.g. split by quarter breaks or gaps in the
  in the data). A separate spline is fit for each segment.
